goodhood
========

An umbrella repository to hold all "semi open source" packages used by GoodHood exclusively.

## Setup

- (Install yarn `npm i -g yarn`)
- Install packages: `yarn`
- Build everything: `yarn run build`
    - _Packages are symlinked between one another as long as their version matches up. That's why it's necessary to build everything at least once._
    - **If you run into weird issues, try re-building.**
